This is a collection of 72 scripts, also called apps, that I developed to enhance functionality of the Window-Eyes screen reader by Ai Squared -- formerly GW Micro.  Each app, its documentation, and other related files are contained in an archive with a .wepm extension, which stands for Window-Eyes Package Management.  This is the same format as a Windows .cab archive.  If Window-Eyes is installed on the computer, an app may be installed either via the App Get feature of the screen reader or by opening the .wepm archive in Windows Explorer.  A free utility called 7-Zip can also open such archives (whether Window-Eyes is installed or not) and is available from
www.7-zip.org
